# Purchasing and Subscribing to a SaaS offer in Marketplace

1. On the product page, select a plan that meets your needs, and then select Set up + subscribe.

1. You're redirected to the Basics tab, where you:

- Define which subscription you want to use for billing. The Azure subscription that you use should have a valid purchase method defined for it. You should have the right level of permissions, or have a resource group under that subscription with the right level of permissions. The billing country/region of the subscription should be a country/region where the offer is available for purchase. Azure subscriptions without a valid payment method (for example, an MSDN subscription) can only be used to purchase free plans.
 **Note:** The following Azure subscriptions can't be used to purchase SaaS: Student, Visual Studio Enterprise, or Free credit.

- Choose or create a resource group to hold the SaaS application.
- Type a name for the SaaS subscription, to easily identify it later. You can't change this name after you have purchased the SaaS subscription.
- Under Plan, you'll see the plan you selected in the product details page (PDP). If you haven't made an active selection in the PDP, you'll see the default plan. You can change your selection by selecting the Change plan link. Then select the plan and billing term you want.
 **Note:** You can only change to another plan that has the same billing term and payment option. For more information, see SaaS subscription lifecycle management.

- In cases where the pricing model is per user, you'll be required to specify the number of users. The price that you see will change based on the subscription, plan, term, and payment frequency that you've selected.
1. Proceed to the Tags tab. Tags are key/value pairs that you can define. You place tags directly on a resource or a resource group, which helps you find your SaaS resource later on. Azure currently supports up to 50 tags per resource and resource group. Place tags on a resource at the time of creation, or add them to an existing resource.

1. Continue to Review + Subscribe to go through the offer and plan details.

- Review the terms of use, amendments, and privacy policy of the publisher, and also Azure Marketplace.
- You might be asked to add your contact details.
- Review details for Basics and Tags.
1. Upon confirmation, select Subscribe.
